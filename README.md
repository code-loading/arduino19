Arduino code from my bachelor project

In this project an arduino was interfaced with a capacitor and a 555 timer which were used to measure the fluid fill level and display it on an LCD. An external software library was used to measure the capacitance. In addition the resistance of the fluid was also measured using a second sensor which was connected to an RC circuit.
